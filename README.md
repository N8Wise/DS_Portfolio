## Data Science Portfolio

Hello, 

Thank you for taking the time to examine some of my projects. In this portfolio you will find both personal projects, and projects completed from coursework. This portfolio will continued to be updated as additional work is completed. If you have any feedback, I welcome construtive criticism and can be contacted at: nate_wise@frontier.com. You will find a summary of projects below, each project is contained in a folder with code and associated data. 

Projects:
* EDA (Project for course Non-Parametric Statistics, recieved score of 48/50): An exploratory analysis of life expectancy and GDP using the gapminder dataset. Code produced in RStudio.   
* Recommendation System (Project for course Intro to NLP (non-graded)): A recommendation system using document similarity. Produced in Jupyter Notebook.
* COMING SOON: NLP school project: Working in a team of 3 with the organization, Allegion PLC, we are conducting an analysis of product reviews to identify areas of success and potential areas for improvement. This project will use text analysis in congruence with data visualization to communicate our findings to Allegion. Code is being produced in Jupyter Notebook.
