## Data Science Portfolio

### Hello Reader,

Thank you for taking the time to examine some of my projects. In this portfolio you will find both personal projects, and projects completed from coursework. This portfolio will continued to be updated as additional work is completed. If you have any feedback, I welcome construtive criticism and can be contacted at: nate_wise@frontier.com. You will find a summary of projects below; each project is contained in a folder with code and associated data.
  
### Projects:  

#### Hospital Readmission of Diabetic Patients
Summary: Lead a team of 3 to create an applet analyzing diabetic patient readmissions to a hospital. Through this applet we peform an EDA, Feature Selection, and explore the best type of model for predicting if a patient will be readmiited to a hospital. Prediction models explored include: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regression and a Neural Network. 
**Code: R (R/RShiny)**

#### NLP Analysis
Project for course Introduction to NLP, recieved score of 100/100  
Summary: Led a team of 3 in collaboration with the organization Allegion PLC, conducting an analysis of product reviews and identify areas of success and potential areas for improvement. To reach our conclusions, we performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction and finally topic modeling.  
**Code: Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

#### Recommendation System
Project for course Introduciton to NLP, non-graded  
Summary: A recommendation system using document similarity.  
**Code: Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
Project for course Non-Parametric Statistics, recieved score of 48/50  
Summary: An exploratory analysis of life expectancy and GDP using the gapminder dataset.  
**Code: R (RStudio)**
